Code Conversion Tool
.NET Framework 4.x Web Forms to .NET 8 Blazor Migration
A powerful web-based conversion tool designed to automate the migration of legacy .NET Framework Web Forms applications to modern .NET 8 Blazor applications.
Overview
This tool streamlines the migration process by analyzing and transforming ASP.NET Web Forms code into Blazor components and pages. It leverages advanced code analysis techniques to handle complex migrations while preserving business logic and functionality.
Features

Comprehensive Analysis: Parses and analyzes Web Forms (.aspx, .ascx) files along with their code-behind files
Intelligent Code Transformation: Converts Web Forms controls to Blazor components
Code-Behind Logic Migration: Transforms event handlers and page lifecycle methods to Blazor paradigms
Master Page Conversion: Converts master pages to Blazor layouts
Server Control Mapping: Maps ASP.NET server controls to equivalent Blazor components
ViewState and PostBack Handling: Strategically replaces ViewState with appropriate Blazor state management patterns
Validation Control Conversion: Transforms validation controls to Blazor validation

Technology Stack

.NET MVC Web Application: Built as a web-based tool for easy access
HtmlAgilityPack: Used for parsing and manipulating HTML/ASPX documents
Roslyn Compiler Platform: Powers C# code analysis and transformation
Advanced Chain Processing: Implements a sophisticated pipeline of processors for step-by-step conversion

How It Works

Upload: Submit your .NET 4.x Web Forms project
Analysis: The tool examines your codebase, identifying components, dependencies, and patterns
Transformation: Code is processed through specialized conversion chains
Output: Download the generated .NET 8 Blazor application structure

Getting Started
